The roll model is estimated using experiment 1 and validated on data from experiment 2
The roll model fits the validation data with **92.9636** %
The pitch model is estimated using experiment 1 and validated on data from experiment 2
The pitch model fits the validation data with **90.7756** %
Roll estimated transfer function is: 

ans =
 
  From input "roll_{cmd}" to output "roll":
         11.61
  --------------------
  s^2 + 14.7 s + 86.69
 
Continuous-time transfer function.

Pitch estimated transfer function is: 

ans =
 
  From input "pitch_{cmd}" to output "pitch":
          12.01
  ---------------------
  s^2 + 15.47 s + 92.71
 
Continuous-time transfer function.
